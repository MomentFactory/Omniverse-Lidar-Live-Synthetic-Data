# MF Lidar live synthetic data [mf.ov.lidar_live_synth]

Adds an Action Graph Node ("Generic/Beam to Ouster UDP") to send Isaac beam data via the Ouster(tm) UDP procotol.
This allows any third party software implementing Ouster(tm) lidars to be connected to simulated sensors instead of physical sensors.

Developped for kit 105.1 and currently working only in Isaac Sim.
This extensions provides pre-built binaries for Windows and Linux x86_64.
